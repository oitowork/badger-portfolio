# Badger Portfolio 

With the retirement of [Sett Vision](https://sett.vision/), a void in user specific reporting has been left for something to fill.  Different user specific metrics are critical for users to track how their deposits are performing and how to best allocate their resources.

The Badger core team has developed an API that is available to consume to provide this information, and is looking for a skilled frontend developer who is proficient in React, Typescript and web3 to develop the Badger Portfolio that will be featured on the main Badger dApp. A design will be provided and specs for the API are documented for reference.

### Expectations
-	A high quality application is produced using the provided design, flowing with the current design processes in the v2-ui repository
-	100% unit testing coverage
-	Work within the existing tech stack of Badger v2-ui
	-	Language: Typescript
	-	Library: React
	-	Framework: material-ui
	-	State Management: mobx
	-	Web3: web3js
